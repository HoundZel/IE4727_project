**NTU EEE IE4727 Web Application Design Project** 

The Objective to this project is to create a working webpage with both front-end and back-end functionality. The theme we selected is as follows:

Theme 1: A web portal for online food ordering/catering services 

You may choose the type of catering service for your application such as NTU canteen, Pizza shops, catering for events and so on. The customer visit the website, browse through the menu and then place orders. Upon finalizing orders, your web application needs to acknowledge the order and provide a means to update the customer on the status of the order, for example, via email. You may also add customer feedback options.

Summary of Project:

Professionals Catering is a doorstep buffet catering service designed to streamline the ordering process for customers. Our web portal allows users to easily browse the menu, view current promotions, and explore best-selling items. Upon logging in, customers can navigate the site to access their past orders and check the status of their current delivery.

When an order is placed, customers will receive an email on the confirmed order. Additionally, our ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù¬† feature provides a platform for customers to share feedback about their catering experience, ensuring we continuously improve our services. This application aims to enhance user experience by providing a simple, efficient way to order catering services while keeping customers informed at every step.
